# FLIGHT_DELAY_ANALYSIS
This is a visualization project based on SPARK and PYTHON based on the flight delay information data set.

The general idea is similar to the previous MOVIE ANALYSIS project. The difference is that due to different data sets, the data to be analyzed cannot be expressed in a similar way. This project uses more methods in the matplotlib package, and the visualized images are more diverse.

Less visual expressions used in MOVIE ANALYSIS will be more reflected in this project

PS!!! due to the reason that the dataset for this project is way too big and it is over the upload limit of GitHub, I upload the HTML file of my project instead.

I believe the HTML version is also good for checking and absolutely reader-friendly.
